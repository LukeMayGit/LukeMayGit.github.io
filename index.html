				<p class="tab">I’ve tried my hand at making many different things. Video games, music, sound effects, software modifications, websites, etc. Out of all my experiences I’ve come to enjoy programming the most.
					<br>I’ve always enjoyed tinkering behind the scenes and using my creativeness in my programming. I like to try new things, see how they look and then refine them or use them for new ideas. 
					<br><br>PROJECTS:
					<br>The Japanese Quiz
					<br>This was my first attempt at creating a program to be sold on an online marketplace. All of the programming, graphics and most of the sound effects were done by me. The quiz was based on an old clothing quiz I did for my Japanese class during high school that I made using Microsoft PowerPoint.

				<p class="tab">When I was younger I studied in several Multimedia courses to try and find something I could enjoy doing that would allow me to get the creative juices flowing and put my desire to create things to good use. I soon discovered that I had a knack for video editing and special effects. 
					<br>I’ve always had a knack for gathering different assets and bringing them together to create something new and interesting. Now-a-days, I use these skills and the knowledge I’ve gained to create my own assets, including graphics, sound effects, music and voices, and use them to make my products stand out amongst the crowd. 
					<br><br>PROJECTS:
					<br>The UFO Video
					<br>This video was part of an assessment done during the Screen and Media courses. My aim was to make the video mysterious and give the audience a sense of unease, leaving them to make their own conclusions about the subject matter.

				<p class="tab">I love media and technology. This love is what has driven me to learn everything I have, and keeps me driven to learn more. In an effort to utilise my knowledge and skills into something profitable, I started my own business that deals with helping people with any technical problems they may have.
					<br><br>I’ve tackled a number of different things, including, but not limited to:
					</p><ul class="tab">
						<li>virus removal</li>
						<li>setting up mobile devices</li>
						<li>diagnosing system faults</li>
						<li>setting up entertainment units</li>
						<li>converting film reels to digital</li>
						<li>extracting data from broken hard drives</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="tab"><br>I’ve even built my own Linux server, complete with it’s own website.
					<br><br>PROJECTS:
					<br>Film to DVD Conversions.
					<br>Computer Repairs.
					<br>Technology Consultation.

					<br>Server Website
					<br>I built this website to be hosted off of my server. Its main use is to allow users of the server to keep track of the server’s status. This is a long-term project that will act as a “playground” for me to test any new ideas out that I think might work well on the website and may incorporate into other website I make in the future.
